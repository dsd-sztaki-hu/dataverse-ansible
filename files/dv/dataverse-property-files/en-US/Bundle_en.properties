Consult the Search API section of the Concorda User Guide for more information on the search queries.
harvestserver.noSets.why.header = What is a Harvesting Server?
harvestserver.noSets.why.reason1 = Harvesting is a process of exchanging metadata with other repositories. As a harvesting <b><i>server</i></b>, your Dataverse can make some of the local dataset metadata available to remote harvesting clients. These can be other Dataverse instances, or any other clients that support OAI-PMH harvesting protocol.
harvestserver.noSets.why.reason2 = Only the published, unrestricted datasets in your Dataverse can be harvested.
